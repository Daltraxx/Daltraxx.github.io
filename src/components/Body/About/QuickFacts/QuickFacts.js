                        Unsure of what to choose as a career path after college, I dabbled with the idea of pursuing economics. 
                        Part of this actually entailed learning to code, with Python being an especially popular tool for economic research and data analysis.
                        My enthrallment with economics didn't last, but with the art of programming at least somewhat demystified, my burgeoning interest in software would only grow since then.

            case '02':
                return <p>
                        Though I started with and attained a solid grasp of Python, once I finally committed to seeking a job in web development, I switched gears to mastering Javascript and a catalogue of related skills.
                        I know it can be done, but programming strictly on the side was torturously slow.
                        The concepts and exercises weren't difficult, but I still felt myself waiting for the larger picture to come together.
                        It wasn't until I had several free months to spend honing the skills I had accumulated that I finally came to feel confident in my abilities,
                        as well as my capacity to contribute to a real team.

                        I never realized the paucity of my tech exposure growing up until I started working in a tech company office.
                        There was a stark contrast between me and the other QA workers, and much more so the programmers.
                        I didn't know a single keyboard shortcut, even rudimentary ones like copy and paste.
                        However, my competencies quickly improved, and my nascent desire to dive deeper into software was ignited.

                return <p>
                        Personal development and self-actualization are overarching obsessions of mine.
                        I follow a manicured routine devoted to these aspirations, a few daily practices of which are meditation, journaling, reading, and exercise.
                        I am also an avid practitioner of the creed that one should code every day (though it is almost always much more than that).
                        Video games have also been near and dear to my heart since childhood, and were the sole thread of my interest in software growing up as I fantasized about making my own.

                        I grew up with the idea that my only real task was to go to college, and I never contemplated much beyond that. I would come to learn what a mistake that was come graduation. 
                        It's now been several years since, and I'd give anything to have discovered programming sooner. I'm doing my best to make up for lost time, 
                        and now all I dream about is the perpetual expansion of my skills, as well as the blissfully endless exploration of new ideas and technologies.
